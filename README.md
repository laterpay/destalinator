# destalinator
Code for managing Cleanup of Stale Channels

# Making it work in your environment
You'll need to change configuration.yaml appropriately.  warner.py and archiver.py
should then work from the commandline.  Productionalized automated deployments
and running on a schedule are left unspecified because every production environment
is unique

# LaterPay Fork

This is LaterPay's fork of https://github.com/randsleadershipslack/destalinator

The main branch for us is `laterpay` (so we can keep clean `master` based on upstream)
